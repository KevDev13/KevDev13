## ðŸ”­ What are you currently working on?

Likely a project for my MSCS from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu) (these are the private repos you see in my GitHub contributions). But my major interests are cryptography and operating systems, so usually I'm working on a project related to one of those.
