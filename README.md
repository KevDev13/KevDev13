## ðŸ“« How can I reach you?

E-mail: kevin@kgar.net (using the PGP key below if you prefer encrypted communication), or kg.dev@protonmail.com.

PGP Key: [E5EA 38B2 0337 6D66 F613 1D90 E82F 518F 966B 93AC](http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?search=0xE82F518F966B93AC&fingerprint=on&exact=on&op=get&options=mr)

## ðŸ”­ What are you currently working on?

Likely a project for my MSCS from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu). When I'm not working on a project for my MSCS, I work on the pinned repos below. They change periodically as my interests change.

## Wait a second... seems like you do a lot of work on private repos. Don't you support open source?

I do, in fact, fully support open source. The only contributions to private repos I make are projects for my MS degree. Due to honor code restrictions I am forced to make my classwork closed-source, as it would be considered cheating by the unviersity to make my classwork open source.
