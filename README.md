## Resume

If you're looking for my resume, it is located [here](https://github.com/KevDev13/resume/blob/main/resume.pdf).

## ðŸ”­ What are you currently working on?

Likely a project for my MSCS from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu) (these are the private repos you see in my GitHub contributions). But my major interests are cryptography and operating systems, so when time allows I'm working on a project related to one of those when not working on a grad school project.
