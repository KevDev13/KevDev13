## Resume

If you're looking for my resume, that is located [here](https://github.com/KevDev13/resume/blob/main/resume.pdf). I use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to format my resume, and use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for my LaTeX editor.

## ðŸ”­ What are you currently working on?

Likely a project for my MSCS from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu) (these are the private repos you see in my GitHub contributions). But my major interests are cryptography and operating systems, so usually I'm working on a project related to one of those.
